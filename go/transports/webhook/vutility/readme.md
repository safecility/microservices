## Vutility hotdrop endpoint

Vutility's hotdrop device working with their API can be configured to pipe data through a webhook.

Our webhook uses Bearer jwt security to verify the connection - the corresponding token can
be set using the Vutility API

### Vutility (plan to?) offer an API less version

This would be our preference
